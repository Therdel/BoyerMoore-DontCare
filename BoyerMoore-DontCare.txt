Changes to Algorithm:
	<Option> Match all non-dontcare areas on their own
		<downside>? does it take advantage of shifting?
	<Option>? Table that answers all possible characters at every position.
	
Open Problems {
	<Prob> Pattern: asdfasdf____ab
	       Matching from the right: BadChar/GoodSuffix both would never shift more than 2 on mismatch in beginning.
		   ?Problem is, that the probability of mismatch few chars in the beginning is higher than mismatch later in pattern.? (intuition)

		<Option> Match chunk-wise. Match chunks longest to shortest. That way BadChar can work its best without falling into dontcare-traps.
}
Changes to BadCharacter:
	Case 1: dontcares in middle {
		Needle		krak_tat
		Needle		kra__tat

		<Fact> A dontcare can be in between any next known or unknown character.
		<Rule> Any mismatching character will fall into the nearest dontcare pit, unless a matching position sits in between

		<Prob> Where to store indices of dontcare areas? {
			<Option> Store only indices of the right-end of dontcare areas
				<Option>	Store a seperate list of the indices
				<Option>	Store indices inside character occurence lists
					<Prob> the fact that particular indices are dontcare positions must be stored seperately
						<Rule> ignore that, pretend the dontcare is the sought-after symbol and shift to it.
				<Option>	Store the seperate list for non-occuring characters
							and the respecting indices inside the lists of existing characters
		}
				
		<Prob> Matching on DontCare Fields. {
			<Option> A: BadChar could respond the amount of DontCare positions to skip checking to the algorithm
			<Option> B: The algorithm could do that itself, too and don't ask its other rules then.
				--> Preprocess DontCare regions, skip over them.
				--> Would result BadChar/GoodSuffix Rules only having to answer to mismatches on true pattern characters.
			--> Rules, like in OG BM, shouldn't be asked when a match occurs, anyway.
			--> Rules don't have to prepare for matching agains DontCare.
		}
	
		<Fact> Mismatch after all dontcares: Business as usual
			   (No mismatches inside dontcares & badchar won't get called on dontcare pos)

	Case 2: Multiple dontcare fields in middle
	Needle		kr_k_tat
	Needle		k__k__at


	Case 2: dontcare(s) in Front
	Needle		_rakotat
	Needle		__akotat
	?

	Case 3: dontcare in Back
	Needle		krakota_
	Needle		krakot__
	?

	Case 4..?: Mixed
